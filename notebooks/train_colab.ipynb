    "\n",
    "### What Was Fixed:\n",
    "The training data loader (`training/data.py` line 36) was using **0-based category indexing** when FasterRCNN expects **1-based indexing** (0 reserved for background class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of the Bug:\n",
    "- ❌ **Previous 50 epochs** of training had misaligned class labels\n",
    "  - Model learned wrong associations between image features and class labels\n",
    "  - Category 0 → Actually category 1 (Duplex Receptacle)\n",
    "  - Category 1 → Actually category 2 (Junction Box)\n",
    "  - And so on... all shifted by one\n",
    "- ✅ **The bug is now fixed** in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means for Training:\n",
    "- **All previous checkpoints are invalid** and should NOT be reused\n",
    "- This training run will start fresh with **corrected category mappings**\n",
    "- Model will learn proper associations between features and the correct electrical symbols\n",
